we only run square_dgemm


optimizations:
blocking
	l1 blocking
	register blocking
	l2 blocking
copy optimization
	copy to aligned buffer
	transpose? // this works
vectorization // doesn't work on cori, is better off automated
	examine assembly...
	intrinsics (better off automated)
	
single-thread! no openmp

TO DO:
transpose + blocking
recursive blocking

TO RESEARCH:
cache blocking
aligned buffer?

blocking with local transpose:		10.9
blocking with full transpose: 		11.2
full transpose: 								13.5

CRAY
full transpose:								15.7
blocked transpose:						13.5
recursive transpose:						14.5
